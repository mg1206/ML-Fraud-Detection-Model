# (UPDATE IN README.md) ML Fraud Detection Model

Used Logistic Regression and Tree Ensemble Models to create a fraud detection classifier capable of accurately flagging fraudulent listings within large online retailers, all within AI4ALL's Ignite accelerator.

## Problem Statement 

Given the large amount of money lost by businesses and consumers to fraud, the identification of such listings are critical, protecting customers from getting scammed and ensuring consumer trust in various businesses.

## Key Results 

Analyzed over 34,000 data entries including product descriptions, reviews, and ratings. 

## Methodologies 

To accomplish this, we utilized a Kaggle dataset of numerous Amazon listings. We then cleaned and preprocessed our data to make it suitable for model usage, using techniques such as SMOTE to ensure balanced data. Finally, we used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to generate results, showing whether a certain listing was fraudulent or not.
